    <h2>Frank Chimero,What Screens Want?</h2>
    <div>I still remember the day I upgraded IOS7 to IOS8, I was so excited and anxious to see what happens when everything’s flat. But now I feel like the UI design is just a kind of fashion design. The excitement than is just a release from aesthetic fatigue. 3-demensional or flat is just aesthetic trends, people’s wander between these styles or maybe more is just like the preference of clothes fashions about whether to wear leopard-print or oversize. There’s really no need to tell what’s right or wrong. <br>
    The questions about screens reminds me of exhibition design which I’m more familiar with. It’s all about what and how to show people and how education works. We say that every exhibition serves educational functions somehow and I think it’s the same with screen. The delivery of information is the core topic, but the endless question happens every time: how to explain and present the things to people as they were originally? Giving people more open space might be a good thing but putting art in white box is pulling away part of art. So where is the line is actually the question to ask.

    <h2>Paul Ford, What is Code?</h2>
    <div>What ‘impresses’ me the most of What is Code is that the navigation bar on the left side is not doing anything at all. I thought it would at least lead me to the section I clicked; turns out it is just a list of content. And I really don’t like the background it uses. Although the pattern corresponds to the topic somehow, it’s like a hint of telling me the article would be hard to understand. </div>

    <h2>Olia Lialina, Vernacular Web 1</h2>
    <div>Olia is bringing an interesting topic about the aesthetic old trends of website appearances and elements. It’s great to look back now because we are living in a new era senselessly and cannot realize the fast pace we are experiencing of moving aesthetic trends. The old elements are important experiments which could be inspiring someday and tells us the progress we are making is not reasonless. Also, looking at the old trends also make us think about today’s senseless modern and try to foresee the future to refine our own design. Only one thing never changes- users’ needs. And that could be the motivation of any success design experiment. </div>

    <h2>Alexander R. Galloway, Jodi's Infrastructure</h2>
    <div>It’s an innovative question to ask whether digitality is a tool or an art itself. We always see coding as a powerful and untouchable tool to assist our life but never sees the artistic potential it carries. Art is far more than paint brushes and sculptures, but everything lies in our life including internet which needs more knowledge to understand and perform. Also, net art seems more similar to a type of coders’ performance art. </div>

    <h2>Samuel Earle, Capitalism vs. Privacy </h2>
    <div>It really got me when it talks about how users are enjoying the convenience brought by the disappearing privacy and big data technology. Born in this era, I am fully drowned into this and don’t care about personal information being analyzed be companies.<br>
    The conversation is a nice remind for people like me to see if we are going too far and if we need to slow down. I remember feeling creepy and frightened when recommendation of one product popped up one day on Taobao happens to be the one I tried on in daytime. I didn’t realize it until then that the personal information we shared probably is way much more than what we expected.
    </div>

    <h2>Louise Drulhe, Critical Atlas of Internet </h2>
    <div>The article explains internet in an interesting way (which I would give my favorite to among all the readings) by visualizing aspects of it. It’s trying to draw the internet out from our understandings and try to analyze it more systematically. Some images seem to have existed in my imagination for a long time and I have never expected one day like this to see those actually presented. Also, comparing to Capitalism vs. Privacy, this one is more objective with less anger.
